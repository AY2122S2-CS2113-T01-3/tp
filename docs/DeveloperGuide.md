## Product scope
### Target user profile

NUS Students who wish to meet as a group (be it for project meetings or to eat together)

### Value proposition

1. Allow a group of students to quickly identify a common time slot such that all of them are free to meet up

2. If no common time slot, allow students to see who is free at certain time slots

3. The longest time slot with the most number of available students should be suggested first, followed by either shorter time slots or time slots where lesser students are able to make it
